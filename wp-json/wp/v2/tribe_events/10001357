As a professional animal behavior specialist and a fervent advocate for animal welfare, my journey has taken me from shelter volunteering to pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science. Along this path, my fascination with reptiles grew, and I had the privilege of visiting the Columbia Reptile Expo last year. Let me assure you, it was an experience that left me in awe, and I'm excited to share my adventure with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Fascinating Menagerie of Exotic Reptiles<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The moment I crossed the threshold into the Columbia Reptile Expo, I was met with a spectacular sight.

From majestic snakes to fascinating lizards, from graceful turtles to some of the most vibrant frogs I've ever had the pleasure of seeing, the diversity of reptiles on display was nothing short of astounding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the highlights of my visit was the opportunity to observe these creatures up close. Armed with binoculars, I could appreciate the fine details of their scales and the colors of their scales.
