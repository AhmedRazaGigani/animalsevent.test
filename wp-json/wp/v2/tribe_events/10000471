Gail and her exceptional Dynamo Dogs have been featured on popular television shows such as The Today Show, Good Morning America, Late Night with David Letterman, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Their fusion of circus expertise and competitive disc dogs created a truly unique and entertaining performance that left the audience in awe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rainforest Reptile Shows<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rainforest Reptile Shows presented by co-founders Michael Ralbovsky and Joaney Gallagher brought an element of intrigue to the PET EXPO.

With over 100 years of collective knowledge, the team provided engaging presentations and answered all the animal-related queries from the curious attendees. From alligator education to the captivating tale of Fred the alligator, the Rainforest Reptile Shows offered entertainment and enlightenment for visitors of all ages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AKC Canine Good Citizen Testing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the proud dog owners out there, the PET EXPO offered AKC Canine Good Citizen testing. This testing assessed basic obedience and manners of dogs, including mixed breeds. The friendly and non-aggressive dogs were evaluated, and owners received a form to send to the AKC for a gold-sealed Certificate of achievement. Additionally, the expo provided an opportunity to showcase your dog's tricks with the AKC Trick Dog test. It's a chance for your furry friend to shine and be recognized for their talents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOGLOVERSDAYS Lure Course<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a family dog who loves agility and acting like a star, the DOGLOVERSDAYS Lure Course was the place to be. This exciting activity allowed your dog to have a ton of fun running an agility lure course. It's an opportunity for them to showcase their speed, agility, and, most importantly, have a wagging good time. Please note that there was a nominal cost associated with participating in the lure course.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The International Cat Association Cat Show<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For all the feline enthusiasts, the Greater Philadelphia PET EXPO featured an impressive cat show approved by The International Cat Association (TICA).

Witnessing the grace, beauty, and unique personalities of these cats was truly a treat for cat lovers of all ages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Piggyvilla<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the PET EXPO, I had the pleasure of visiting the Piggyvilla display presented by the Tri-County Pot-Bellied Pig Club. This exhibit aimed to educate the public about pot-bellied pigs and their owners while showcasing the entertaining and lovable nature of these animals. Daily demonstrations provided insights into pot-bellied pig behavior and tricks that you could teach your own pet pig. Whether you already have a pet pig or are considering one, this educational display offered valuable information to help you make an informed decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Neverland K9 Dog Training Demonstration<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dog training is an essential aspect of responsible pet ownership, and the Neverland K9 Dog Training Demonstration showcased the key principles of successful training. Through engaging demonstrations, they emphasized the importance of timing, motivation, and consultation in training dogs to become well-behaved companions. Additionally, the team showcased nose work demonstrations, highlighting how the learned skills can be applied in various activities.
