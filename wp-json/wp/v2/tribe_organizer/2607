At the time, there was no central registry of purebred dogs, and the AKC was created to provide a comprehensive and standardized system for recording the pedigrees of purebred dogs.<\/p>\n<p>In 1887, the AKC held its first dog show, and the organization has since grown to become the largest registry of purebred dogs in the United States. Today, the AKC is a not-for-profit organization that is dedicated to promoting the responsible ownership and breeding of purebred dogs.<\/p>\n<h2>Events<\/h2>\n<p>The American Kennel Club conducts several events throughout the year, including dog shows, obedience trials, agility trials, and scent work trials. These events provide a platform for dogs and their owners to showcase their skills and compete against other dogs in their breed.<\/p>\n<h2>National Dog Show<\/h2>\n<p>The National Dog Show is one of the largest and most prestigious dog shows in the United States. It is held annually on the day after Thanksgiving and features over 2,000 dogs competing in over 200 different breeds and varieties. The National Dog Show is broadcast on NBC and is watched by millions of people across the country.<\/p>\n<h2>Obedience Trials<\/h2>\n<p>Obedience trials are events where dogs and their owners perform various obedience exercises, such as heeling, sit and stay, come when called, and jumping.

The AKC divides these breeds into seven categories: Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting, and Herding.
