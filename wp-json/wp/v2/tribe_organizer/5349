I had a blast when I visited the last time it happened. Here's what you can expect to find:<\/p>\n<h3>Exotic Reptiles of All Kinds<\/h3>\n<p>From lizards to snakes, arachnids to frogs, you'll find a huge variety of exotic reptiles at the Central Valley Reptile Expo. The animals are displayed by some of the top breeders and animal specialists in the country, who are happy to provide information and guidance on your next purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>Pet Events and Specials<\/h3>\n<p>Many of our events include both a reptile and a pet event housed separately under a single price admission. You'll have representation from local retailers and manufacturers offering discount coupons and free samples, as well as adoption and rescue groups looking to re-home dogs and cats that need a loving home.<\/p>\n<h3>Great Deals<\/h3>\n<p>If you like saving money, then you'll love the Central Valley Reptile & Pet Expo. You'll find many vendors with prices way below what you see in stores or online. The prices you find at our expos are so low you'll want to purchase in bulk and save.<\/p>\n<h3>Animal Presentations<\/h3>\n<p>If interacting with a large snake, primate or alligator is your thing, you'll love the Wild About Monkeys show. Kevin and his team of celebrity animals always entertain the crowd. This show includes a baboon, a capuchin monkey, a very large snake and even an alligator, and is a really fun additive to an already great event.<\/p>\n<h3>Vendors, Suppliers, and Breeders from Across the Country<\/h3>\n<p>At all Central Valley Reptile Expo events, you'll find thousands of amazing animals and products that you can see, touch, and possibly take home, adding another member to your family. You'll also find some of the best exotic animal vendors and the top manufacturers of exotic animal products available. Our vendors are industry leaders, curators, and lovers of animals. Most are local businesses from right here in the Central Valley.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the Central Valley Reptile Expo is a fun-filled experience for the whole family. I highly recommend that all reptile parents, reptile owners, reptile lovers, reptile vendors, and reptile accessory sellers come and check out this amazing event when it happens.
