As an animal behavior specialist with over a decade of experience working with a wide range of animals, my journey in the world of animal welfare has been a source of immense joy and fulfillment. Beyond my professional work, I also dedicate my spare time to volunteering at an animal shelter, where I deepen my understanding of the needs and behaviors of various animals. Inspired by remarkable individuals like Annemarie Lucas from &#8220;Animal Precinct,&#8221; I embarked on my path in animal welfare as a shelter volunteer, eventually leading me to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science in 2009.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My passion for pets and animal welfare knows no bounds. With nearly 12 years of experience working with diverse creatures, including reptiles, birds, and farm animals, I&#8217;ve launched AnimalsEvent.com, a platform dedicated to helping pet owners deepen their understanding of their furry friends. Through AnimalsEvent, I aim to share my knowledge, provide a comprehensive directory of nearby animal events and pet expos, and connect people with like-minded pet enthusiasts. Today, I&#8217;m excited to take you on a journey through the extraordinary PetPalooza event, where we celebrate the incredible bond we share with our pets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I.
