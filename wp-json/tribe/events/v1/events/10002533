I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of creatures, from cuddly domestic pets to exotic animals. My commitment to understanding and promoting animal welfare has driven me to volunteer at an animal shelter in my spare time, providing me with invaluable hands-on experience. This involvement has allowed me to gain insights into the complex needs and behaviors of various animals, helping me become a more effective advocate for their welfare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey in the realm of animal welfare began with a single step\u2014volunteering at an animal shelter. Inspired by remarkable individuals like Annemarie Lucas from Animal Precinct, my fascination with animal welfare transformed into a full-fledged career. I embarked on a journey of discovery that eventually led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science in 2009. My years of formal education, combined with over a decade of practical experience, have equipped me with a deep understanding of animals and their behavioral science. This knowledge brings me immense joy and fulfillment, and I&#8217;m passionate about sharing it with others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With nearly 12 years of experience working with a wide range of animals, including reptiles, birds, and farm animals, I&#8217;ve decided to extend my reach and knowledge. Hence, I launched AnimalsEvent.com, a platform dedicated to helping pet owners deepen their understanding of their furry friends. Through AnimalsEvent, I aim to share my knowledge and provide a comprehensive directory of nearby animal events and pet expos.
