is a not-for-profit organization that was founded in 1884. It is dedicated to promoting the study, breeding, exhibiting, and improvement of purebred dogs. The AKC is one of the largest and oldest kennel clubs in the world, and it is the largest registry of purebred dogs in the United States.<\/p>\n<h2>History<\/h2>\n<p>The American Kennel Club was founded in 1884 by a group of 13 sportsmen and dog lovers who wanted to promote the breeding of purebred dogs in the United States. At the time, there was no central registry of purebred dogs, and the AKC was created to provide a comprehensive and standardized system for recording the pedigrees of purebred dogs.<\/p>\n<p>In 1887, the AKC held its first dog show, and the organization has since grown to become the largest registry of purebred dogs in the United States. Today, the AKC is a not-for-profit organization that is dedicated to promoting the responsible ownership and breeding of purebred dogs.<\/p>\n<h2>Events<\/h2>\n<p>The American Kennel Club conducts several events throughout the year, including dog shows, obedience trials, agility trials, and scent work trials. These events provide a platform for dogs and their owners to showcase their skills and compete against other dogs in their breed.<\/p>\n<h2>National Dog Show<\/h2>\n<p>The National Dog Show is one of the largest and most prestigious dog shows in the United States. It is held annually on the day after Thanksgiving and features over 2,000 dogs competing in over 200 different breeds and varieties. The National Dog Show is broadcast on NBC and is watched by millions of people across the country.<\/p>\n<h2>Obedience Trials<\/h2>\n<p>Obedience trials are events where dogs and their owners perform various obedience exercises, such as heeling, sit and stay, come when called, and jumping. Obedience trials test a dog&#8217;s ability to follow commands and work with its owner. The AKC sanctions obedience trials throughout the year, and the organization also sponsors the AKC National Obedience Championship.<\/p>\n<h2>Agility Trials<\/h2>\n<p>Agility trials are events where dogs navigate an obstacle course that includes jumps, tunnels, weave poles, and more. Agility trials test a dog&#8217;s athletic ability, speed, and agility. The AKC sanctions agility trials throughout the year, and the organization also sponsors the AKC National Agility Championship.<\/p>\n<h2>Scent Work Trials<\/h2>\n<p>Scent work trials are events where dogs use their sense of smell to locate hidden objects. Scent work trials test a dog&#8217;s ability to locate a specific odor, and the trials can be used to train and certify dogs for search and rescue, detection, and other roles that require a keen sense of smell.<\/p>\n<h2>Breeds<\/h2>\n<p>The American Kennel Club recognizes over 200 breeds and varieties of dogs. The AKC divides these breeds into seven categories: Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting, and Herding. Each breed has its own unique characteristics, history, and personality, and the AKC provides detailed information about each breed on its website.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The American Kennel Club is a not-for-profit organization that was founded in 1884 to promote the breeding of purebred dogs in the United States. Today, the AKC is the largest registry of purebred dogs in the country, and the organization conducts several events throughout the year, including dog shows, obedience trials, agility trials, and scent work trials.
