This testing assessed basic obedience and manners of dogs, including mixed breeds. The friendly and non-aggressive dogs were evaluated, and owners received a form to send to the AKC for a gold-sealed Certificate of achievement. Additionally, the expo provided an opportunity to showcase your dog&#8217;s tricks with the AKC Trick Dog test. It&#8217;s a chance for your furry friend to shine and be recognized for their talents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">DOGLOVERSDAYS Lure Course<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a family dog who loves agility and acting like a star, the DOGLOVERSDAYS Lure Course was the place to be.

It&#8217;s an opportunity for them to showcase their speed, agility, and, most importantly, have a wagging good time.

This exhibit aimed to educate the public about pot-bellied pigs and their owners while showcasing the entertaining and lovable nature of these animals. Daily demonstrations provided insights into pot-bellied pig behavior and tricks that you could teach your own pet pig. Whether you already have a pet pig or are considering one, this educational display offered valuable information to help you make an informed decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Neverland K9 Dog Training Demonstration<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dog training is an essential aspect of responsible pet ownership, and the Neverland K9 Dog Training Demonstration showcased the key principles of successful training.
