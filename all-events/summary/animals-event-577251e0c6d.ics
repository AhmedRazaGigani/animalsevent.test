SUMMARY:Greater Philadelphia PET EXPO
DESCRIPTION:Hello\, pet parents\, pet owners\, pet lovers\, pet vendors\, and pet accessory sellers! I recently had the pleasure of attending the Greater Philadelphia PET EXPO\, and let me tell you\, it was an absolute blast! This pet-centric event was a true paradise for anyone with a love for animals. From thrilling performances to educational exhibits\, this expo had something for everyone. In this article\, I'll take you on a journey through my experience at the Greater Philadelphia PET EXPO\, highlighting the exciting activities and attractions that await you. So\, grab your kids and get ready to be amazed! \n\n\n\nGail Mirabella And The Dynamo Dogs\n\n\n\nOne of the major highlights of the PET EXPO was the captivating performance by Gail Mirabella and The Dynamo Dogs. This talented dog variety act showcased their incredible skills\, ranging from Frisbee® dog acrobatics to trick dog show routines. Gail and her exceptional Dynamo Dogs have been featured on popular television shows such as The Today Show\, Good Morning America\, Late Night with David Letterman\, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Their fusion of circus expertise and competitive disc dogs created a truly unique and entertaining performance that left the audience in awe. \n\n\n\nRainforest Reptile Shows\n\n\n\nThe Rainforest Reptile Shows presented by co-founders Michael Ralbovsky and Joaney Gallagher brought an element of intrigue to the PET EXPO. These shows featured a variety of fascinating creatures\, including animals rescued from Fish and Wildlife confiscations and unwanted pets. With over 100 years of collective knowledge\, the team provided engaging presentations and answered all the animal-related queries from the curious attendees. From alligator education to the captivating tale of Fred the alligator\, the Rainforest Reptile Shows offered entertainment and enlightenment for visitors of all ages. \n\n\n\nAKC Canine Good Citizen Testing\n\n\n\nFor all the proud dog owners out there\, the PET EXPO offered AKC Canine Good Citizen testing. This testing assessed basic obedience and manners of dogs\, including mixed breeds. The friendly and non-aggressive dogs were evaluated\, and owners received a form to send to the AKC for a gold-sealed Certificate of achievement. Additionally\, the expo provided an opportunity to showcase your dog's tricks with the AKC Trick Dog test. It's a chance for your furry friend to shine and be recognized for their talents. \n\n\n\nDOGLOVERSDAYS Lure Course\n\n\n\nIf you have a family dog who loves agility and acting like a star\, the DOGLOVERSDAYS Lure Course was the place to be. This exciting activity allowed your dog to have a ton of fun running an agility lure course. It's an opportunity for them to showcase their speed\, agility\, and\, most importantly\, have a wagging good time. Please note that there was a nominal cost associated with participating in the lure course. \n\n\n\nThe International Cat Association Cat Show\n\n\n\nFor all the feline enthusiasts\, the Greater Philadelphia PET EXPO featured an impressive cat show approved by The International Cat Association (TICA). This cat exhibition brought together both common and unusual cat breeds to compete for the coveted blue ribbon. Witnessing the grace\, beauty\, and unique personalities of these cats was truly a treat for cat lovers of all ages. \n\n\n\nPiggyvilla\n\n\n\nAt the PET EXPO\, I had the pleasure of visiting the Piggyvilla display presented by the Tri-County Pot-Bellied Pig Club.

Daily demonstrations provided insights into pot-bellied pig behavior and tricks that you could teach your own pet pig. Whether you already have a pet pig or are considering one\, this educational display offered valuable information to help you make an informed decision. \n\n\n\nNeverland K9 Dog Training Demonstration\n\n\n\nDog training is an essential aspect of responsible pet ownership\, and the Neverland K9 Dog Training Demonstration showcased the key principles of successful training. Through engaging demonstrations\, they emphasized the importance of timing\, motivation\, and consultation in training dogs to become well-behaved companions. Additionally\, the team showcased nose work demonstrations\, highlighting how the learned skills can be applied in various activities. Watching the dogs and their trainers work together as a united team was both inspiring and informative. \n\n\n\nBeyond Imagination Alpaca Ranch\n\n\n\nAt the PET EXPO\, I had the unique opportunity to get up close and personal with the adorable and cuddly alpacas at Beyond Imagination Alpaca Ranch. These gentle creatures with their soft fleece were an absolute delight to observe and touch. The educational exhibit provided valuable insights into the world of alpacas and their fascinating characteristics. It was truly a sensory experience that left me with a deep appreciation for these lovable animals. \n\n\n\nBarnes Yard Petting Zoo And Pony Rides\n\n\n\nChildren attending the PET EXPO had a blast riding ponies and interacting with the friendly animals at the Barnes Yard Petting Zoo. From adorable rabbits to gentle goats\, this petting zoo provided a hands-on experience for kids to learn about different animals and their behaviors. Please note that there was an additional charge for pony rides. \n\n\n\nA Helping Wing Parrot Rescue\n\n\n\nParrot enthusiasts had the opportunity to visit A Helping Wing Parrot Rescue at the PET EXPO. This organization is dedicated to placing parrots in loving and responsible adoption families. Their mission extends beyond adoption; they also aim to educate families about the proper care and well-being of these intelligent birds. Observing the beautiful parrots and learning about their unique personalities was a memorable experience. \n\n\n\nJohnny Peers And The Muttville Comix\n\n\n\nPrepare to be entertained by Johnny Peers and his delightful canine companions known as The Muttville Comix. Johnny Peers\, a graduate of the Ringling Brothers Clown College\, has been working with dogs for decades. This talented troupe of rescue dogs has been featured on various television shows and captivated audiences worldwide.
