SUMMARY:Richmond VA Reptile Expo
DESCRIPTION:As a dedicated animal behavior specialist\, my passion for the well-being and welfare of animals has led me down various intriguing paths in my professional journey. I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of creatures\, from cuddly domestic pets to exotic animals. My commitment to understanding and promoting animal welfare has driven me to volunteer at an animal shelter in my spare time\, providing me with invaluable hands-on experience. This involvement has allowed me to gain insights into the complex needs and behaviors of various animals\, helping me become a more effective advocate for their welfare. \n\n\n\nMy journey in the realm of animal welfare began with a single step—volunteering at an animal shelter. Inspired by remarkable individuals like Annemarie Lucas from Animal Precinct\, my fascination with animal welfare transformed into a full-fledged career. I embarked on a journey of discovery that eventually led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science in 2009. My years of formal education\, combined with over a decade of practical experience\, have equipped me with a deep understanding of animals and their behavioral science. This knowledge brings me immense joy and fulfillment\, and I'm passionate about sharing it with others. \n\n\n\nWith nearly 12 years of experience working with a wide range of animals\, including reptiles\, birds\, and farm animals\, I've decided to extend my reach and knowledge.
