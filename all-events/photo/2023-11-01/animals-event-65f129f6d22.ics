SUMMARY:AKC National Tracking Invitational
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to the world of AKC National Tracking Invitational\, an extraordinary event designed to celebrate the exceptional tracking abilities of our furry friends.

This unique event evaluates a dog's proficiency in tracking and following scents across diverse environments. Dogs are trained to trace a specific scent trail left by a person\, often hours old\, amidst various terrains and weather conditions. It's truly remarkable to witness the precision and dedication these dogs exhibit as they navigate the course. \n\n\n\nCanine tracking skills are a marvel of nature\, and the AKC National Tracking Invitational is a platform that truly celebrates this extraordinary talent. Dogs' sense of smell is estimated to be tens of thousands of times more sensitive than humans\, and they can detect scents that are barely discernible to us. This event puts their olfactory abilities to the test\, allowing them to showcase their natural talents in a challenging and rewarding environment. \n\n\n\nThe primary goal of the AKC National Tracking Invitational is to provide a platform for dogs to demonstrate their tracking skills. These skills\, often underutilized in modern domestic settings\, harken back to the canine's origins as hunters and trackers. By participating in this event\, dogs get to embrace their natural instincts and engage in a fulfilling activity that brings out their true potential. \n\n\n\nEarning Prestigious Tracking Titles\n\n\n\nAt the AKC National Tracking Invitational\, dogs have the opportunity to showcase their tracking skills and training proficiency.

To earn the TD title\, a dog and handler must navigate a track that is between 440 and 500 yards long with three to five turns and aged between 30 minutes to two hours. It's a challenging test of a dog's tracking skills and obedience.\n\n\n\nTracking Dog Excellent (TDX): The TDX title represents a higher level of tracking proficiency. To earn this title\, a dog must follow a track that is a minimum of 800 yards long with five to seven turns\, aged between three and five hours\, and include various distractions along the way. This title demonstrates a dog's advanced tracking abilities and perseverance.\n\n\n\nVariable Surface Tracking (VST): The VST title takes tracking to the next level by testing a dog's adaptability. Dogs must follow a track that is between 600 and 800 yards long with four to eight turns\, aged between three and five hours\, and feature different surfaces\, such as concrete\, asphalt\, and gravel. This title showcases a dog's ability to track effectively in various challenging conditions.\n\n\n\n\nAchieving these titles is a testament to the bond between a handler and their dog\, as well as the dog's innate tracking skills.
