SUMMARY:Northern Nevada Exotic Pet Show Winnemucca
DESCRIPTION:As a dedicated animal behavior specialist with a profound passion for pets and animal welfare\, my journey into the enchanting world of animals has led me to explore various facets of their lives. From volunteering at an animal shelter to earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science\, my quest to understand and advocate for animals has been an incredible adventure. This journey of discovery has recently taken me to the Northern Nevada Exotic Pet Show in Winnemucca\, Nevada.
