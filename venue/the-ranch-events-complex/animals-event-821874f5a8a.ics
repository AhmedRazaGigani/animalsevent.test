Bearded dragons basked regally under heat lamps\, while chameleons showcased their remarkable ability to change colors. I also had the pleasure of encountering some lesser-known species\, further enriching my understanding of these captivating reptiles. \n\n\n\nTurtles: Shelled Marvels\n\n\n\nTurtles\, often overshadowed by their snake and lizard counterparts\, had their time to shine at the event. From the majestic sea turtles to the petite box turtles\, it was evident that these shelled creatures have their own unique charm.
