SUMMARY:Richmond VA Reptile Expo
DESCRIPTION:As a dedicated animal behavior specialist\, my passion for the well-being and welfare of animals has led me down various intriguing paths in my professional journey. I have had the privilege of working with a diverse range of creatures\, from cuddly domestic pets to exotic animals.

Inspired by remarkable individuals like Annemarie Lucas from Animal Precinct\, my fascination with animal welfare transformed into a full-fledged career.
